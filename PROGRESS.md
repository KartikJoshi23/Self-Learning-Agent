## Current status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Current phase** | **Phase 4 — Development (Tier 1: M0–M4)** |
| **Phase state** | Tier 1 approved. **M0 complete and verified (10/10 acceptance checks).** M1 next. |
| **Blocked on** | Nothing. |
| **Next action** | **M1** — physics core: pvlib ModelChain hourly yield + Kimber soiling calibrated to DEWA 0.14-0.33 %/day, HSU as cross-check. Acceptance: uncleaned accumulation reproduces DEWA daily rates AND annual specific yield lands in 1,700-1,900 kWh/kWp. Also outstanding: read arXiv:2603.07518 in full before M2 freezes the env design. |
| **Code written so far** | `rimal/config.py`, `rimal/data/power.py`, `tests/test_power.py` (14 tests, all passing), `scripts/m0_verify.py`. |

## Phase gates

Phases run in order. None may be skipped or combined. Each gate needs the
Master's explicit approval before the next phase begins.

| # | Phase | State | Approved by Master |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Read + confirm methodology (`Problem-Solving-Skill.md`) | ✅ Complete | ✅ Yes — 2026-08-29 |
| 2 | Deep research + agent concept proposal | ✅ Complete (audited, 8 corrections) | ✅ Yes — 2026-08-29 |
| 3 | Full implementation plan | ✅ Delivered (`IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`) | ✅ **Tier 1 approved** — 2026-08-29 |
| 4 | Development — Tier 1 (M0–M4) | 🔵 In progress: M0 ✅, M1 next | — |

## Fixed project constraints

These do not change without the Master saying so explicitly.

- **Zero cost.** No paid APIs, no paid compute, no paid datasets, no cloud bills.
- **Repository is public** and stays public (Master decision, 2026-08-29).
- **Laptop-only.** Must train and evaluate on a CPU laptop. No GPU cluster assumed.
- **Employability first, government pitch second.** The primary deliverable is a
  portfolio-grade, interview-defensible build. A government pitch is a follow-on
  only if the build works.
- **Methodology is binding.** `Problem-Solving-Skill.md` applies to every phase.
- **Five concept criteria** (all must hold simultaneously): genuine Dubai/UAE
  government relevance · UAE recruiter-market relevance · genuine originality
  (not what most builders would produce) · real self-learning/RL depth (not an
  LLM wrapper) · grounded in citable research.

## Done

### Phase 1 — Methodology (complete, approved)
- Read `Problem-Solving-Skill.md` in full (six phases + checklist).
- Confirmed understanding with the Master and mapped each methodology phase onto
  this project's research-and-selection work.
- Master confirmed and supplied the zero-cost / laptop-only and
  employability-first constraints.

### Phase 2 — Research (complete, audited, approved)
- Surveyed UAE/Dubai government strategy landscape: Dubai Universal Blueprint for
  AI, UAE National AI Strategy 2031, Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050, UAE Water
  Security Strategy 2036, D33 economic agenda, Dubai Future Foundation funding tracks.
- Surveyed the UAE AI hiring market for 2026 (demand/supply gap, what employers
  screen for, where candidate saturation is).
- Surveyed the technical literature on PV soiling, cleaning-schedule optimisation,
  and the RL methods relevant to it.
- Confirmed free, laptop-viable data and tooling exists for the recommended concept.
- Evaluated five candidate concepts against the five criteria; recommended **RIMAL**.
- **Audited the whole research pass; found and corrected 8 errors (2 material).**
  Findings and audit log written to `RESEARCH.md`.

### Phase 4 / M0 — Data layer (complete, verified 2026-08-29)
- Project scaffold: `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.venv`, pytest config.
- `rimal/config.py` — site constants and DEWA-derived calibration values, each traced to source.
- `rimal/data/power.py` — NASA POWER hourly fetcher, per-year chunking, parquet cache,
  `-999` fill-value handling, local-time and daily-summary helpers.
- 14 tests passing (12 offline + 2 live-API guards).
- **`scripts/m0_verify.py` — 10/10 acceptance checks PASSED.** Figure at `figures/m0_ghi_aod.png`.

**Two findings from M0 worth carrying forward:**
1. **NASA POWER serves `AOD_55` hourly.** One API supplies both irradiance and the dust
   driver, with no registration. **Copernicus CAMS leaves the critical path; risk R6 closed.**
2. **The hourly JSON cap is on payload size, not time span.** Measured: 9 parameters x 3
   years succeeds, 9 x 5 is rejected (HTTP 422), 4 x 5 succeeds — the cap sits between 27
   and 45 parameter-years. An earlier belief that ">1 year is rejected" was wrong and has
   been corrected in code, docstring and test. Per-year chunking retained as it is
   comfortably inside the cap.

## Next up

- **M1** — physics core. pvlib `ModelChain` hourly yield; Kimber soiling calibrated to
  DEWA 0.14-0.33 %/day; HSU as cross-check.
  **Acceptance (declared before build):** uncleaned accumulation reproduces DEWA measured
  daily rates, *and* annual specific yield lands in the published Dubai band of
  1,700-1,900 kWh/kWp. If either fails, the physics is wrong — stop, do not proceed to M2.
- **Before M2:** read arXiv:2603.07518 in full and close the open unverified claim.

## Known unverified claims

Per `Problem-Solving-Skill.md` Phase 6 — report reality, not intention. These are
believed true but were **not** confirmed against the primary source:

| Claim | Why unverified | How to close |
|---|---|---|
| Exact state / action / reward formulation of arXiv:2603.07518 (Heungjo An, *RL-based dynamic cleaning scheduling framework for solar energy system*), and whether it treats soiling as latent. | Abstract confirmed via arXiv, but the abstract does not state the formulation. Full PDF not yet read. | **Read the PDF before milestone M2 freezes the environment design.** This determines which of the four differentiation axes are genuinely unclaimed. |
| DEWA Autonomous Soiling Detector specifics. | dewa.gov.ae returns HTTP 403 to automated fetch; details taken from the UAE Media Office mirror. | Read the DEWA press release directly in a browser. Low impact — not load-bearing for the design. |

### Closed by the 2026-08-29 audit

Eight errors were found in the original Phase 2 presentation and corrected. Full log in
[RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) §6. Two were material:

- **E1 (critical)** — the PPO/SAC Abu Dhabi RL result was misattributed to the MDPI *Systems*
  paper. They are two different works; the RL paper is **arXiv:2603.07518** (March 2026), and
  the *Systems* paper is simulation-optimisation, not RL.
- **E2 (material)** — the water–energy nexus framing was overstated by roughly 2–15×, and
  DEWA's 2026 trial uses **dry** robots consuming no water. Water demoted from a reward term to
  a CMDP constraint; novelty re-centred on stochastic action efficacy and actuator degradation.

## Maintenance rules for this file

1. Update **Current status** every session — especially "Next action".
2. Move finished work into **Done** under its phase heading.
3. Log every session in **Session log** with a real commit hash once the repo exists.
4. Anything asserted but not verified goes in **Known unverified claims**. Do not
   quietly drop rows from that table — close them with evidence.
5. Never mark a phase gate approved unless the Master actually approved it.
